# Sustainable Social Network

An innovative platform that connects people committed to the environment. The main goal is to promote waste collection and the organization of community clean-up events.

## What the Platform Offers

- **Event Organization**: Tools to create, promote, and manage clean-up and environmental awareness events.
- **Reward System**: Gamification that rewards active users with points redeemable for sustainable products or discounts.
- **Community**: Forums and groups to share tips, achievements, and coordinate local actions.
- **Interactive Map**: Visualization of collection points, nearby events, and areas that need attention.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Angular for a dynamic and reactive interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for a fast and scalable API.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with spatial extensions (PostGIS) for map functionalities.

This project seeks to create a real positive impact, using technology to mobilize the community in favor of a cleaner planet.
